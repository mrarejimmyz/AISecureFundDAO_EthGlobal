# Coding Standards for AISecureFundDAO

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for developing the AISecureFundDAO project. These guidelines ensure clean, secure, and maintainable code across all components, including smart contracts, AI modules, and the user interface.

---

## General Standards

1. **Consistency**:

   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces or tabs) throughout all files.
   - Follow camelCase for function and variable names in Solidity and JavaScript.
   - Use snake_case for Python variables and functions.

2. **Modular Design**:

   - Break down functionalities into reusable components.
   - Avoid monolithic code; each function should have a single, well-defined purpose.

3. **Documentation**:

   - Add comments to explain the purpose of functions, variables, and logic.
   - Use standardized docstrings for Python and NatSpec comments for Solidity.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages.
   - Use feature branches for new functionalities.

---

## Smart Contracts Standards

1. **Solidity Version**:

   - Use the latest stable version of Solidity (e.g., `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`).

2. **Gas Optimization**:

   - Minimize gas consumption by avoiding excessive loops and redundant operations.
   - Use `memory` instead of `storage` where possible.

3. **Security Best Practices**:

   - Implement proper access control using modifiers like `onlyOwner`.
   - Avoid external calls within critical functions to prevent reentrancy attacks.
   - Use `require()` for input validation and `assert()` for internal consistency checks.

4. **Naming Conventions**:

   - Functions: camelCase (e.g., `submitProposal()`).
   - Variables: camelCase (e.g., `totalVotes`).
   - Constants: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., `MAX_BID_AMOUNT`).

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all functions using Hardhat or Truffle.
   - Include edge cases in tests to ensure robustness.

## AI Component Standards

1. **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**:

   - Use federated learning or differential privacy when processing sensitive data.
   - Ensure encrypted data remains protected during AI model training.

2. **Explainability**:

   - Implement techniques like SHAP values or attention mechanisms to make AI decisions interpretable.

3. **Efficiency**:

   - Optimize algorithms to reduce computational overhead within TEEs.
   - Test AI modules with representative datasets to ensure scalability.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear explanations of AI models, including input/output formats and decision logic.

## Frontend Standards

1. **Frameworks**:

   - Use React.js with TypeScript for building the user interface.

2. **Accessibility**:

   - Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure accessibility for all users.
   - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements.

3. **Styling**:

   - Use CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Tailwind CSS.
   - Maintain consistent design across all pages using a design system.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using Jest or React Testing Library.
   - Include end-to-end tests with Cypress to simulate user interactions.

---

## TEE Integration Standards

1. **Secure Communication**:
   - Use RA-based TLS for secure communication between TEEs and other components.
2. **Attestation**:

   - Implement remote attestation to verify TEE integrity before processing sensitive data.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Log errors securely within TEEs without exposing sensitive data.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Optimize TEE workloads using Marlinâ€™s auto-scaling capabilities.

---

## Testing Standards

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual modules (e.g., smart contracts, AI algorithms) in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**:

   - Validate interactions between components (e.g., smart contracts, TEEs, frontend).

3. **End-to-End Tests**:

   - Simulate real-world user scenarios to ensure the system behaves as expected.

4. **Tools**:
   - Use Hardhat for smart contract testing, Pytest for Python modules, and Jest/Cypress for frontend testing.

---

## Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs at both frontend and backend levels.
2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storing or transmitting it.
3. **Reentrancy Protection**:

   - Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern in Solidity functions.

4. **Audit Trails**:
   - Maintain immutable logs of critical operations within TEEs and smart contracts.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch (`feature/`).
2. Write clean, well-documented code adhering to the standards above.
3. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions of changes made.
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
